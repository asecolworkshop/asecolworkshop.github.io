<p><h3><center>Workshop on Software Support for Collaborative and Global Software Engineering</center></h3></p>

<p><h4><center>Tuesday, November 10, 2015</center></h4></p>

<p><h5><center>to be held in conjunction with the</center></h5></p>
<p><h5><center>The 30th IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering Conference (ASE 2015)</center></h5></p>


<p> Automated software engineering, and software engineering in general, has a rich history around the issues of collaboration. One might argue that many of the tools, models, and studies that have been reported in the ASE conference series have in one way or another had to do with collaboration. This workshop seeks specifically to highlight collaboration as a specific lens or framework for assessing the state of the art in automated support for collaborative and global software engineering. In taking this focus, issues about integrative solutions, open problems, and a research agenda will emerge. </p>
<p>Themes of workshop include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Models of collaboration, including specific aspects such as awareness, trust, or coordination; </li>
  <li> Empirical studies, both qualitative and quantitative, including ethnographic studies, surveys, and case studies;</li> 
  <li> Software tool support for collaboration, including analytics, user interface issues, and cognitive support; </li>
  <li> Issues of context, e.g. radically co-located and globally distributed collaborations, and degrees in-between;</li>
  <li> Social and organizational issues, including trust, privacy, and incentives.</li>
</ul>
